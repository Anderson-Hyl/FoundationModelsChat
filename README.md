## ðŸ§© Architecture

The project utilizes **The Composable Architecture (TCA)** for clear, testable, and modular state management. The following diagram illustrates the current reducer structure:

%%{ init : { "theme" : "default", "flowchart" : { "curve" : "monotoneY" }}}%%
graph LR
    AppReducer ---> AppDelegateReducer
    AppReducer ---> OnboardingReducer
    HomeReducer ---> DialogsListReducer
    HomeReducer -- optional --> MessageListReducer
    MessageListReducer ---> MessageListInputReducer

    AppDelegateReducer(AppDelegateReducer: 1)
    DialogsListReducer(DialogsListReducer: 1)
    MessageListInputReducer(MessageListInputReducer: 1)
    MessageListReducer(MessageListReducer: 1)
    OnboardingReducer(OnboardingReducer: 1)
